# Read me!

I am learning how to `code` ... and I like to push!

And I am learning how to `git`!

I am doing the [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn/basics/getting-started) now.

This is need if you install on fresh system without `npm`:
```
sudo apt update
sudo apt install npm
```

This is how you start the next.js server:
```
cd hello-next
npm install 

npm run dev
```
